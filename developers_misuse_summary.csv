employee misuse leads to attempt to sell source code
"AN IT worker of ele.me has been detained for leaking data of over 65,000 employees.  Police said yesterday that the suspect, a man surnamed Xiang, claimed that he did so because the company was being “unfair” to him. Xiang was working as a senior research and development engineer at ele.me, a leading online food ordering platform.  The company reported the leak to Putuo police at 11pm last Thursday after staff at its risk control department discovered that the data of its employees, including their names, sexes and mail addresses, had appeared on a website."
"The Tel Aviv district attorney on Sunday charged six people, including a computer programmer formerly employed as a Welfare and Social Services Ministry contractor, in connection with a massive data theft that exposed the personal details of millions of Israelis.  According to the indictment, filed in the Tel Aviv District Court, 55-year-old Shalom Bilik had access to the population registry database as part of his contract computer maintenance work in the Welfare and Social Services Ministrys information systems department. In 2005- 2006, during his time at the ministry, Bilik began to make copies of the population registry data and sold it, the indictment said.  As a result of the data theft, detailed personal information on 9 million Israelis, among them minors, deceased persons and citizens living abroad, was exposed to publication, including on various overseas websites and file sharing sites.  Allegedly, as well as copying the database, Bilik also copied monthly population registry data updates that the Interior Ministry sent to the Welfare and Social Services Ministry. In 2005, before his contract at the ministry ended, Bilik allegedly took a copy of the stolen data to a haredi (ultra-Orthodox) organization in Jerusalem, where he provided database services connected with the organizations donors.  Bilik copied the stolen database onto the organizations computer, together with a program he had written while at the ministry, which allowed users to create queries to retrieve information from the database, the indictment said."
" A former senior software architect at Microsoft has been arrested and charged over allegedly stealing Windows 8 trade secrets and passing them along to a tech blogger in France.  Former senior architect Alex Kibkalo, apparently because he was unhappy with a recent performance review, is accused of passing the secrets that included vital details about Windows 8 RT and ARM devices, as well as a server SDK that could have allowed hackers to reverse engineer-critical code.  Kibkalo is alleged to have leaked vital Windows 8 code to an unnamed blogger in 2012 prior to the release of the software.  Microsoft had noticed something was amiss when screenshots started appearing in tech blogs across the world revealing details of the upcoming release.  Having spent seven years working for Microsoft, Kibkalo is alleged to have leaked Windows 8 code to a French technology blogger in mid-2012, prior to the softwares release. Kibkalo was apparently angry over a poor performance review.  Writing the court, a Seattle-based FBI special agent said Microsoft brought its concerns to him in July, nearly a year after corporate investigators suspected Kibkalo had leaked parts of Windows 8. He is said to have admitted to passing the information to the blogger  unidentified in charging papers  after a meeting in an online forum.  Kibkalo, a Russian national who worked there and in Lebanon for Microsoft, also alleged to have stolen Microsofts Activation Server Software Development Kit, a propriety system used to prevent the unauthorized copying of Microsoft programs.  Corporate investigators confronted Kibkalo in September 2012 during an interview in which hes alleged to have admitted to sharing the software. Kibkalo is alleged to have admitted to sharing unreleased Windows programs as well as company memos and documents; Microsoft investigators claim he was angry after a poor performance review.  According to charging papers, the blogger posted screenshots of a pre-release version of Windows 8, presumably due to Kibkalos leak.  On Sept. 3, 2012, the blogger sent the stolen software development kit code to a Microsoft employee asking that he or she verify it, the FBI agent said in court papers. The worker went to a Microsoft executive instead.  The code was later confirmed to be authentic, prompting corporate investigators to dredge the Hotmail account the blogger used to contact the Microsoft worker. While the blogger took pains to protect his identity  he claimed falsely to be in Quebec and used an assumed name online  a Microsoft team dubbed Trustworthy Computing Investigations attempted to track the blogger down.  While searching the bloggers account, Microsoft investigators found an email from Kibkalo in which he shared Windows 8 hot fixes through an online hosting system, the FBI agent continued. Windows 8 had not been released to the public at the time, and was the subject of much speculation in the industry."

"The settlement concludes the decade-long saga springing from a computer-assisted scam that Eddie Tipton, former IT director for the Multi-State Lottery Association in Urbandale, ran on the national lottery. Tipton added a secret code to ""random"" number-generating computer software in 2005 that allowed him to narrow the drawing-winning odds in multiple games from as great as 5 million-to-1 down to 200-to-1.   Tipton's scam went undetected for years, and the code was replicated in lottery computer software across the nation. He hijacked at least five winning drawings totaling more than $24 million in prizes in Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma, court records show."
